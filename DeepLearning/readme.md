## Digit_recognition_fast
    use the image as it is, the first layer of the neural network being the image flatten.
## Digit_recognition_complex
    use convolution and pooling to preprocess the image before introducing it in neurons layers.
    This gives small improvement in accuracy for this type of AI, but it is a good concept to learn
