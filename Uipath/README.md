# Robotic Process automation - Allocation of optional subjects

This project aims to assist individuals responsible for allocating optional subjects. It involves multiple workflows:

    1. Creating a form using an Excel file.
    2. Randomly filling out the form. Since the form is completed using the same email,
         emails will be replaced with a predefined set.
    3. Actual allocation.
    4. Sending emails with the allocation information.
